# Lunarfetch

Lunarfetch is an incomplete reimplementation of [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) written in Rust. This project is still work in progress and lacks a lot of features. Contributions welcome!

## How to Build

If you have a Cargo installed just run

```bash
cargo build -r
```

### Nix

There is also a Nix flake for this project.

After you have cloned the Git repo, run `nix shell` to get a shell with lunarfetch. Or add this Git repo to your flake config if you are already maintain one.
